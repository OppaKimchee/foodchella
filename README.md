- When you first enter Foodchella, you will be greeted by the doorman to register or login (you will not be able to post dericious foods if not!).
- You are permitted to at least stare at the dericious foods thought and see what exotic locations they arrived from...(mmm doesn't that make you want to register moar?)
- Once registered or logged in, you gain access to the VIP lounge called the hamburger menu.
- in the VIP lounge you will be greeted by smooth elevator music DJ, access to awesome games like BLACK JACK 21 by Justin Kim™, or Jerry's Mancala, even AJ's Wheel of Fortune! WOW! (omg why havn't u registered yet?!)
- You also gain voting privileges on foods to show how much you love someones food and we get to see the top voted foods on the main stage.
- Once your done with the festivities (because the festivities never end) you may exit through the logout door but don't worry as your credentials are safe and foods in Foodchella never go bad!
- So make sure you come back and visit again soon!
